BIFE is a kind of framework inspired by Bif <http://www.lunix.com.ar/Bif.php>
to split a PHP application (website or whatever) into 3 layers:
XML:  Content management.
PHP:  Programming.
HTML: Look & Feel (it can be other type of output, not just HTML).

The main goals of this proyect are:
- Keep XML layer really easy to use for the end user, so no need of HTML or
  PHP would be needed to make a XML page.
- Speed. One of the main goals of this proyect is to be fast. Because of
  this, PHP and HTML layers can have extra complications.

You can see the tentative ROADMAP.
